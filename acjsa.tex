\section{Origins}

The JCMT Science Archive
\citep[JSA;][]{2008SPIE.7016E..16G,2008ASPC..394..450E,2008ASPC..394..135G,2011ASPC..442..203E}
hosts raw and reduced data from the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope. As
ACSIS \citep{2000ASPC..217...33D} and SCUBA-2
\citep{2003SPIE.4855....1H} were being developed it became clear that
the data rates from these instruments were going to be significantly
higher than earlier generation submillimeter instrumentation. In
particular SCUBA-2 was the first generation of submillimeter camera
that could be considered to be suitable for use as a large-scale
survey instrument. Expoloratory discussions on the JSA between JCMT and CADC
began in 2003 and culminated in a decision to approve the
collaboration in May 2005 \citep{2005JCMTN23}. Development effort was
obtained in-house and also from the addition of two programmers recruited from
the UK Starlink project \citep{1982QJRAS..23..485D}, which had recently been closed.

The commitment to a JCMT Science Archive was followed shortly
afterwards by the approval of the JCMT Legacy Survey programme in July
2005 \citep{2005JCMTN23}. To ensure survey participation in the JSA
the JCMT Data Users' Group (JDUG) was created in early 2006 to provide
stakeholder input into the pipeline operation and advanced data
products. \citep{2006JCMTN24R}.

\section{Motivation: Observatory}

Submillimeter data has traditionally been rather esoteric, closer to
radio than the optical/infrared regime familiar to most
astronomers. Raw data is typically in time series format (Fig.~\ref{fig:g34ts}), and requires
in-house algorithms for transformation to science-ready formats such
as spectra or images (see e.g.\ Fig.~\ref{fig:g34}). Calibration is
difficult due to the dominant and highly variable effect of the water
vapour in Earth's atmosphere
\citep[e.g.,][]{2002MNRAS.336....1A,2013MNRAS.430.2534D}.

\begin{figure}[t]
\includegraphics[angle=-90,width=\columnwidth]{g34ts}
\caption{Single bolometer time-series from a subset of a SCUBA-2
  pointing observation of G34.3. The final image is show in
  Fig.~\ref{fig:g34}. The negative spikes are the detections of the
  bright central source.}
\label{fig:g34ts}
\end{figure}


JCMT invested significant effort in automated data reduction based on
the ORAC-DR pipeline framework
\citep[][\ascl{1310.001}]{1999ASPC..172...11E,1999ASPC..172..171J,2005ASPC..347..585G,2008ASPC..394..565J}. In
many cases these automatically generated products were publication
quality, and thanks to a constantly updated calibration model, better
than what an inexperienced astronomer could be expected to achieve on
their own. Moreover with the advent of large bolometer arrays such as
SCUBA-2 \citep{2013MNRAS.430.2513H}, this data could be processed in
maps that resulted in image data that could be readily understood by
non-submm specialists, an example of which can be seen in Fig.~\ref{fig:g34}.

\begin{figure}[t]
\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{g34}
\caption{SCUBA-2 observation of G34.3.}
\label{fig:g34}
\end{figure}

The JCMT had in-house experience with setting up a data archive in the
``filing cabinet'' sense of allowing users to search and retrieve data.

Indeed, distribution of publication-quality data became an issue of
the highest priority with the advent of the JCMT Legacy Survey
Programme \citep{2010HiA....15..797C,2008ASPC..394..450E} using the
SCUBA-2 and HARP/ACSIS \citep{2009MNRAS.399.1026B} instruments. Aside
from the normal desire to provide a uniformly reduced product to the
survey teams, the processing demands for this data required a
non-trivial IT infrastructure . Due to the iterative algorithms
utilized by the SCUBA-2 map-maker
\citep[SMURF;][]{2013MNRAS.430.2545C}, the more data could be
co-processed, the higher the fidelity of the solution, and circa 2008,
machines with specifications such as 64\,GB of RAM were not readily
available to the typical JCMT observer. So there were intrinsic
reasons to have a JCMT Science Archive allowing the survey consortia
to download the processed products. Ultimately, usage of such an
archive would be dominated by JCMT users retrieving their own data, or
after the proprietary period elapsed, other JCMT users working in the
same scientific areas.

JCMT formed a strong interest in going further, and exposing its
high-value data product to data-mining astronomers who would not have
a priori knowledge either of JCMT in particular or sub-mm astronomy in
general. To that end, the VO data discovery and publication protocols
seemed like a natural choice for reaching the large parts of the
astronomical community that were oblivious to its existence. VO
publication would also have the advantage of exposing the JCMT data
sets to workhorse tools that VO-savvy astronomers already used, such
as TOPCAT \citep[][\ascl{1101.010}]{2005ASPC..347...29T} and Aladin
\citep[][\ascl{1112.019}]{2005ASPC..347..193O}.

However, despite being convinced of the desirability of
leveraging the VO tools and services for JCMT data, the observatory
had the usual constraints of time and effort. The small Scientific
Computing Group was busy with supporting the entire non-hardware-controlling
software suite at both JCMT and UKIRT \citep[see e.g.,][with both
telescopes operated by the same organization]{2002SPIE.4844..321E,2011tfa..confE..42J},
as well as developing data reduction for new instruments
and supporting the JCMT Legacy Surveys. The ability to develop a
VO-aware data center and support the demands of the hoped-for
increased usage base was just not there.

What JCMT had, however, was a pre-existing collaboration with CADC,
which hosted the older JCMT data archive \citep{1997ASPC..125..397T}
for the benefit of the Canadian astronomical community, Canada being
one of the three international partners funding the JCMT (the other
two being the United Kingdom and the Netherlands). CADC had early
involvement in VO protocols \citep{2002ASPC..281...36S}, was a
productive developer and enthusiastic supporter of VO standards, and
was known to ``eat its own dog
food''\footnote{\url{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_your_own_dog_food}}
by using many of these
interfaces and services internally.

\section{Motivation: Data Centre}

\begin{figure*}[t]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{acjsa_fig3}
\caption{AdvancedSearch Results.}
\label{fig:asresults}
\end{center}
\end{figure*}

CADC already had a varied collection of data from several
telescopes and space missions
\citep{1994ASPC...61..123C,2008SPIE.7016E..16G}. Keen to be able to
extend its holdings to new observatories and data sets while
requiring only a small and well-defined effort, CADC developed
the Common Archive Observation Model
\citep[CAOM:][]{2007ASPC..376..347D,2008ASPC..394..426D}.  CAOM defines an extensive and
versatile data model that classifies every data file using a common set of physical,
observational, organizational, and processing metadata.
This allows a generic VO search tool, such as AdvancedSearch, to search the
entire set of CADC archives for data relevant to a chosen target in the sky.
% that allowed any data to be ingested in the CADC
% archive provided it could be adequately mapped to CAOM.

One of the main attractions of the JCMT data set was its significant
departure from many of the common forms of other astronomical data,
that predominantly came from optical and IR instrumentation. JCMT data
frequently comes in Galactic co-ordinates, up to 4 dimensions (2
spatial, wavelength and polarization) and has a diverse set of
products, including spectra, data cubes, maps, previews showing both spectral
and spatial images,  and catalogs for point sources, emission peaks and
clumps (extended regions of non-uniform emission).  The JCMT
provided an excellent stretch to the model; if JCMT data could be
described in CAOM, CADC would be in the unprecedented position of
being able to accept almost any data set from future observatories
with minimal changes to their system.

Another advantage in working with JCMT on its datasets, was the high
level of completion and accuracy that JCMT provided in its
metadata. Astronomical data archiving with poor or incomplete metadata
becomes problematic verging onto untenable, especially when trying to
meet the bar of a ``Science Archive'', when science-ready data products
have to be delivered to the user. JCMT's dedication to high-fidelity
metadata and quick response in the rare case of problems made this an
attractive test data set.

The success of
this approach can be seen from the screen shot in Fig.~\ref{fig:asresults},
which shows the reduced (Calibration Level 2) data from May 2014, sorted by
observation date, filtered to remove reduced-450\,$\upmu$m data (since the atmosphere
at 450\,$\upmu$m is often very opaque) and to include observations with RA $>$ 125.0 deg.
A pop-up preview of G34.3 is shown; clicking would bring up a larger version
of the preview in a new tab.  The \texttt{productID} column shows the kind of data that
can be downloaded for each selection, giving the product type (reduced data files in
this example) and basic wavelength information (filter for continuum observations,
rest frequency and spectrometer configuration for heterodyne observations).

\section{A Continuous Release Model}

Using CADC's data processing infrastructure and the capabilities of
JCMT/UKIRT's ORAC-DR automated data reduction, the JCMT Science
Archive adopted a model of continuous release
\citep{2011ASPC..442..203E}. As data was taken it was pushed for
reduction and was ingested at CADC in the same 24-hour period it was
observed. Thus, high-quality science products were published in the VO
as soon as the PI had access to them. Moreover, with every major
improvement in the data reduction software, data could be re-processed
and again immediately released.

Continuous release made the VO publication mechanisms even more useful
than they are in the normal data discovery process, as product
availability is, from the point of view of the astronomer,
unpredictable rather than coming in fixed, scheduled, announced ``data
releases''.

\section{Post-Observatory}

Meanwhile, CADC was working on the Canadian Advanced Network for
Astronomical Research \citep[CANFAR;][]{2010SPIE.7740E..51G} project aiming to
support a cloud-like model for astronomical data reduction. The system
is based on giving the user a Virtual Machine (VM) that is then customized to
provide the appropriate software, environment and data access. The
user then defines a number of jobs that are serviced on a Condor
compute platform composed of customized VM copies.

This service is clearly of great utility to the Canadian astronomical
community dealing with large data volumes, in this case the artifacts of
the Gould Belt Legacy Survey \citep[GBS;][]{2007PASP..119..855W}.
In its use of CANFAR, the GBS data
processing lifecycle is supported at every step by VO-compliant services.
Raw data is retrieved from VO-compliant discovery and delivery services,
that data is processed on the customized VMs provisioned on CANFAR, and
the resulting products are shared among survey members in VO-compliant
storage services using VOSpace \citep{vospace}.

The existence of the VOSpace system at CADC has also led to them
taking on the role of data publisher for JCMT science papers, allowing
externally reduced products to be uploaded and associated with a
Digital Object Identifier. The first two data sets making use of this
functionality were \citet{2012MNRAS.424.3050W} and
\citet{2013ApJS..209....8D}.

\section{The optical-centric VO}

In the early days of the Virtual Observatory, the focus was
specifically on simple protocols \citep{siap,cone} to replace pre-existing
web services for image retrieval and cone search; with retrieval of
individual spectra coming somewhat later in VO developments
\citep{ssap,splatvo}. These were the pressing issues of the optical
community and this discussion dominated early protocol development.

Data cubes were seen as a task for the future as it was
felt that they were products that were not yet in the mainstream and
optical/IR IFU instruments \citep[such as
UIST;][]{2004SPIE.5492.1160R} were seen as something interesting for
the future. This was frustrating given that JCMT heterodyne
observations regularly generated cubes and with the arrival of ACSIS
in 2006, gigabyte data cubes were commonplace. There was no standard
available for making all these cubes available to the VO and it is
only recently \citep[e.g.,][]{2014AAS...22325505T} that a cube access
protocol has been approached with any seriousness, driven mainly, in
the USA, by ALMA and JWST developments \citep[e.g.,
MIRI;][]{2010SPIE.7731E..10W}.

Another peculiarity of sub-millimetre data is the lack of point
sources. Most Galactic objects are extended and dust and gas from
large clouds, outflows and filamentary structures are missed by
standard source extraction algorithms such as SExtractor
\citep[][\ascl{1010.064}]{1996A&AS..117..393B}. Instead, algorithms
such as Fellwalker \citep[][\ascl{1311.007}]{2007ASPC..376..425B} and
Clumpfind \citep[][\ascl{1107.014}]{1994ApJ...428..693W}, which detect
source emission in irregularly-shaped clumps, were used when
doing source finding. VO ConeSearch was not
set up for this eventuality and the best we could hope for was to
provide a catalogue that indicated the peak of the emission. To work
around this problem clump catalogues are generated with the clump
outline approximated by a polygon specified in STC-S format
\citep{2010ASPC..434..213B}. These outlines can then be retrieved
using TAP for analysis or plotting. This is certainly less convenient
for the end user than a clump equivalent of ConeSearch so we are
extending the facilities in GAIA
\citep[][\ascl{1403.024}]{2009ASPC..411..575D} to hide the TAP
interface. Ideally a variant of ConeSearch will be developed that
worked for extended irregular sources.

\section{Current Status}

The collaboration has proven so successful that the opportunity was
taken to transfer the UKIRT raw data from the Cassegrain instruments
to CADC \citep{adassxxiii_P01}. It has also been possible to re-use
the JSA processing infrastructure for UKIRT data processing as the
pipeline environment is identical.

The JSA data processing continues to be improved
\citep{2014JCMTN35..19J} and the current plan is to reduce all the
public HARP/ACSIS and SCUBA-2 data using an ``all-sky'' HEALpix
projection \citep{2014SPIE9152-93,2014JCMTN35..20B}. This processing
will also result in catalogue products that are specifically designed
to answer the question of whether the JCMT saw any emission in a
particular part of the sky. This is achieved by doing a two-pass
approach to clump
finding where first the emission outline is determined, and represented
by an STC-S polygon, and then the individual peaks are located
\citep{2014JCMTN35..21G}.

There is also an intent to expand the holdings of the JSA to include
heterodyne data taken in an older format by the DAS
\citep{1986SPIE..598..134B} and AOS-C backends. Data from those
instruments is being converted to the newer ACSIS format and this
allows all the standard processing infrastructure to be used to create
reduced data products and make them available to the VO for the first
time.

{\color{red}
The JSA pioneered the use of CAOM at the CADC being implemented in both
CAOM-0.9 and CAOM-1.  The latest version, CAOM-2
\citep{2013ASPC..475..159R,2012ASPC..461..339D},  was released for general
use on 2014 May 1 and includes clarifications and improvements due to
lessons learned from the earlier models.
The metadata that is available for searching is richer, more complete, and easier
to understand than anything that has been available previously.

%Migrated to CAOM-2.0 \citep{2013ASPC..475..159R,2012ASPC..461..339D}
%with lots of new features for VO and Advanced Search.
}

\section{Lessons Learned}

The JCMT Science Archive collaboration was a high successful foray
into VO publication via an observatory-data centre collaboration.

Elements that we believe led to this success:

\begin{itemize}
\item VO publication was a common goal with significant organizational
  buy-in for both parties from the start, and was a primary technical
  goal of the collaboration rather than an afterthought.

\item Within that shared vision, there was a clear division of
  expertise and responsibilities for each side, allowing each
  organization to focus on its proximate technical goals. Both
  organizations had ``skin in the game'' that were served by the
  technical work undertaken, which allowed this work to be carried out
  without any kind of external agency funding (each institution
  supported its own share of the work out of its normal budgetary
  process).

\item Each organization worked from a position of strength based on an
  advanced, robust and mature software architecture, allowing
  development to focus on new functionality and interfaces between the
  two systems. This minimized the communication overheads commonly
  associated with distributed project.

{\color{red}
\item The role of ``data engineer'' responsible for developing software to
ingest new data into a CAOM archive no longer requires special privileges
at the CADC.  It does require an expert
knowledgable about both the CAOM model and the products generated
by the data reduction system, but the tools developed for CAOM
allow this role to be assigned to the best available expert regardless of their
location or institutional association.  Thus, for UKIRT, the JAC has been able to
assign one of their own staff to this role, and for the JSA a retired CADC staff
member currently fills the role.
}

\item There was a high level of pre-existing trust between the two
  groups from their previous relationship leading to minimal need for
  contractual language or management oversight. Indeed the entire
  collaboration's only official governance document was a two paragraph
  memorandum of understanding.
\end{itemize}

\section{Recommendations}

In the general case, for observatories that do not understand the
mechanisms or benefits of VO publication, collaboration with a
motivated VO-involved data centre that has the appropriate
infrastructure and keeps up to date with the IVOA standards process is
a far more effective choice than trying to develop those capabilities
in-house, especially since there seems to be confusion in the
observatory community as to what ``VO publication'' involves and what
are the merits of doing it.

However, in order to be able to properly leverage the capability of a
modern multi-mission data centre, a fanatical devotion to correct and
complete metadata should be considered a pre-requisite.

{\color{red}
Good communications within the team of collaborators is essential.  Regular
weekly or bi-weekly teleconferences and occasional face-to-face meetings
have been important to keeping everyone aware of issues and working to
common purposes.
